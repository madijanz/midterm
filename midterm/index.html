    	<h1 class="early"><i>Early Life</i></h1>
    	<p><a name="earlylife"></a>Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born on 20 February 1988,[18] in Saint Michael, Barbados. Her mother, Monica (Braithwaite), is a retired accountant of Afro-Guyanese background, and her father, Ronald Fenty, is a warehouse supervisor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Barbadian" target="_blank">Afro-Barbadian</a> and Irish descent. Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships. She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street.</p>

    	<h2>Family Life</h2>
    	<p>Rihanna's childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to 
    	<ul>
    		<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">Crack Cocaine</a></li>
    		<li>Alcohol</li>
    	</ul>

    	which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. As a child, she went through a lot of CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered: "[The doctors] even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense." By the time she was fourteen, Rihanna's parents had divorced and her health began to improve.</p>

    	<h2>Music Influences</h2>
    	<p>Rihanna grew up listening to reggae music and began singing at around the age of seven. She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combermere_School" target="_blank">Combermere High School</a>, where she studied alongside future England cricketer Chris Jordan and future West Indies cricketer Carlos Brathwaite. Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme; the singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant. Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.</p>

    	<h1 class="four"><b>Public Image</b></h1>
    	<p><a name="publicimage"></a>Known for reinventing her style and image, Rihanna's music and fashion sense are noted by the media.In 2009, <i>New York</i> magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of "a cookie-cutter teen queen", noting she has the ability "to shift looks dramatically and with such ease". Around the time of the release of her second studio album, <i>A Girl like Me</i> (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with <i>Look</i> magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyonce: "Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles". She revealed during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Prime" target="_blank"><i>Oprah's Next Chapter</i></a> that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, "I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was." With the release of her third album, <i>Good Girl Gone Bad</i> (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller <i>Æon Flux</i> (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.</p>

    	<h2>Long Career</h2>
    	<p>Nico Amarca of <i>Highsnobiety</i> magazine wrote "over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics" target="_blank">aesthetic</a> metamorphoses the world has ever seen".Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album.She commented that as a child she "used to watch her [mother] get dressed" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mom. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, "It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off." Jess Cartner-Morley of <i>The Guardian</i> wrote that "Rihanna's wardrobe is 
    	<ul>
    		<li>The most talked-about</li>
    		<li>Influential</li>
    		<li>Dissected</li>
    	</ul>

    	in pop right now" and that whatever she wears "is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, "I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting."</p>

    	<h2>Cultural Expectations</h2>
    	<p>In an interview with Alexa Chung during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" target="_blank"><i>Vogue</i></a> Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson, and Prince. Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, she said "[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it". In a May 2013 interview with MTV, <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, "I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented."</p>
